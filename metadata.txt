description=Table-format viewer and editor for RORB .catg and .stm files — batch-edit print flags in catchment files and create or edit storm files interactively.
about=RORB catg/stm Editor displays RORB text files in interactive, colour-coded tables instead of raw text, so you can work with them without risking the underlying file structure.
    <br><br>
    <b>CATG Editor</b> — Open a .catg file and view nodes, reaches, storages, and inflow/outflow sections in a structured table. The main purpose is batch print-flag editing: set node print flags (0 / 70 / 71 / 72) and reach print flags (0 / 1) across many rows at once, instead of clicking each node one-by-one in the RORB Graphical Editor. Filter and search by node name or index. All other data is read-only and preserved exactly on save.
    <br><br>
    <b>STM Editor</b> — Open an existing .stm file or create a new non-uniform storm file from scratch. The New STM wizard scaffolds a complete file (event header, storm parameters, burst time ranges, pluviograph data, sub-area rainfalls, pluviograph references, and hydrograph stations). Every section is shown as an editable table where you can add or delete bursts, pluviographs, and hydrograph stations — storm parameter counts sync automatically. Delimiter format (tab or comma) and -99 terminators are managed by the editor.
